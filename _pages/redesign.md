title: Redesigning danny.is in the open
layout: essay
---

After the example of [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2019/redesign/) and [Rob Weychert](https://v7.robweychert.com/), I'm redesigning this site in the open. It's been a long time since I spent some quality time with CSS, and I'm enjoying it hugely. I'm also loving the feeling of freedom I get from blogging about it like it's 2005.

If this site looks buggy or unfinished, that's because it is. Once it gets to a certain point I'll move it from [beta.danny.is](https://beta.danny.is) to [danny.is](https://danny.is). That point will come long before everything is polished, or even finished.

If some of the articles on here seem self-indulgant, that's because they are. I'm writing them because I **really** miss writing like I used to â€“ scrappily, without planning, and about whatever I'm into _right now_. This is my little corner of the internet, after all.

If you don't want to read about my scrappy journey through this redesign, never fear. When this goes live you'll be able to subscribe to just the properly-written, properly-edited stuff. But if you do, the stuff I've written so far is below. If you read and enjoy any of this, please [tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@dannysmith%20) or [email me](mailto:hi@danny.is?subject=Hey%21%20I%20enjoyed%20your%20website%20redesign%20stuff&body=%28No%20need%20to%20write%20anything%20here%20if%20you%20don%27t%20wanna%29) to say so.
