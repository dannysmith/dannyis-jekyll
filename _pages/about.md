I write on this **website**, and publish a regular **newsletter** on remote working, leadership and tech.

I’m Technology Director at **[RED Academy](https://redacademy.com/)**.

I consult on remote working, eremote work, leadership, process and learning with my friends at **Better at Work**.

I'm slowly building **Foundry Academy**.

I occasionally **design and build websites** for small, local businesses.

In the last few years I’ve worked at **[Ada College](https://ada.ac.uk/)** and **[CharlieHR](http://charliehr.com/)**. Before that, I helped to build **[Sparta Global](https://www.spartaglobal.com/)**.

I'm care deeply about creating environments where people can do great work, genuinely enjoy it, and are able to make the right decisions – both for themselves and for their company. I strongly believe this leads to better lives and better businesses. Work should not be a chore. 

It's kinda hard to describe my work at Red Academy, but it's mostly leadership stuff with a sprinkling of learning experience design.

While I'm a software engineer by trade, I've slowly come to realise that I have a much bigger impact if I focus on helping other people do their thing better. So while I still code, It's mostly for fun these days.

When it comes to helping folks enjoy their work, right now I'm mostly busy with:

* Helping people design and establish useful and reliable systems & processes.
* Simplifying existing processes (and the mental models needed to habitualise them).
* Coaching other leaders and managers.
* Facilitating a bunch of meetings and workshops.
* Listening to people. Lots.
* Designing and running training.
* Automating away some of the really shitty work. (Hot take: "No code" tools are revolutionary.)
* Championing remote work and a remote-first culture. I mostly work remote right now, as does my absolutely awesome team.
