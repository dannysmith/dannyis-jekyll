This is a [**now page**](https://nownownow.com/about). Thanks to [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff) for the idea.

I spend most of my time working with the folks at [Delocate](http://delocate.co) to help people get better at remote work, but I also do a bit of consulting on leadership, learning design and [Notion](http://notion.so) stuff.

## Side Projects

- I'm publishing a bunch of [short, practical remote working tips](/remote).
- I have a tiny very-part-time agency called [Tavern](https://taverndesign.com/) where I occasionally work on brands and websites for local businesses with my friend Bruce.
- I’m redoing this website.

## Living

I live in a lovely little mews in Islington, North London. When I’m not having a barbecue with my neighbours I’m probably [at the pub](https://twitter.com/armssmyth).
