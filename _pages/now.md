This is a [**now page**](https://nownownow.com/about). Thanks to [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff) for the idea.

I'm mostly working with the folks at [Oyster](https://www.oysterhr.com/) to improve their internal operations and remote ways of working. I'm also doing a bit of consulting on leadership, learning design and [Notion](http://notion.so) as well as being a personal coach for a few people.

I was previously working at [Delocate](http://delocate.co), helping people get better at remote work – we're still wrapping up a few projects.

## Side Projects

- I'm publishing a bunch of [short, practical remote working tips](/remote).
- I'm in the early stages of developing some paid courses on remote working.
- I’m slowly redoing this website.
- I have a tiny very-part-time agency called [Tavern](https://taverndesign.com/) where I occasionally work on brands and websites for local businesses with my friend Bruce.

## Living

I live in a lovely little mews in Islington, North London. When I’m not having a barbecue with my neighbours I’m probably [at the pub](https://twitter.com/armssmyth). Or at least I was until all the pubs closed.
