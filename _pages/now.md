This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Thanks to [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff) for the idea.

What am I doing now, then?

## Working

I’m working as **Technology Director** at [RED Academy](https://redacademy.com/). I’m also **Curriculum Director for Technology** at RED.

I’m also working with my friend Bruce to create a small design studio called **Tavern**. We’re doing branding and websites for small – mostly local – businesses.

I also do a bit of consulting on remote work, leadership, process and learning with **Better at Work**.

## Side Projects

I’ve got a podcast in the works.

I’m redoing this website.

## Living

I’m still living in a little mews in Islington, North London.

When I’m not having a barbecue with my neighbours I’m probably [at the pub](https://twitter.com/armssmyth).
