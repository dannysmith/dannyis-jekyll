## Technical Constrains

1. They must be on google fonts, because **simplicity**.
2. I'd prefer variable fonts because they're new and fun to play with, and they're likely to reduce page weight.

I also want a clear visual distinction between "content copy" and "UI copy". The former plays the lead role and the latter a host of supporting roles.

---

* Does it show off the content?
* Is it easy and pleasant to read at multiple user font sizes?
* Does it work in both light and dark modes?
* Is it suitable for both dense paragraph-heavy copy and more sparse copy like lists?
* Do I think it's beautiful?


Human vs Systems
Can I use a "Human" feeling font for article copy and a font more evocative of carefully designed, ordered systems for the UI copy?

## Values

* Simple
* Beautiful
* Authentic
* Content-first
