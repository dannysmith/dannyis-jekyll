title: Website Redesign Part XI - Code Blocks and Section Rules
---

I spent a long time [deciding on a typeface]({% post_url 2020-06-20-website-redesign-v %}) for these essays and I don't want to spend nearly as long on code snippets. Although this series involves a lot of code snippets, I generally write about code a lot less than I used to, so it doesn't make sense to spend ages on this. I use the wonderful [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/blog/introducing-operator) in my text editor and I briefly considered paying for a web license so I could use it here too. But while _I_ love it, it's quite unusual and is definitely not suited to everyone's taste. Both the typeface itself and the act of buying a web license are the opposite of simple, one of my stated values for this site. So instead, I'll stick with the same requirements I used before: open source, ideally with variable and static versions, with nice ligatures and a range of weights.

The first thing that came to mind was Fira Code, an extension of Mozilla's Fira Mono which was designed specifically for legibility. Fira Code adds a bunch of ligatures for character combinations commonly used in programming, as well as making a few adjustments to make code more readable.

## The CSS

Although Fira Code is available via google Fonts it doesn't support all the opentype features I want, so I ended up cloning the repo and moving TFF, WOFF and WOFF2 versions into the the assets folder like I did for Literata. They're included in `webfonts.scss` and have a custom property set just like the other fonts too.

```css
:root {
  --font-code: 'Fira Code', 'Inconsolata', monospace;
  @supports (font-variation-settings: normal) {
    --font-code: 'Fira Code Variable', 'Inconsolata', monospace;
  }
}
```

Since we want to use Fira code _everywhere_ there's code, we can set this as the default font for all `code` elements, whether inside essays or not. We can also use some of the advanced stylistic settings to turn on a sans-serif lowercase 'r' and put gaps in double equals signs. I think this makes code a little more readable.

```scss
code {
  font-family: var(--font-code);
  font-feature-settings: 'ss01', 'ss08';
  // sso1 = sans-serif lowercase "r"
  // ss08 = Gaps in double/tripple equals
  // See https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/How-to-enable-stylistic-sets
}
```

Fira code has a bunch of other features like this

### Styling inline code

We'll set the font size to the same as the samm-caps we're using for abbreviations, which is about equal to the x-height of the body copy. Adding a border, background and a little padding to the left and right is the simplest thing I can think of to differentiate inline code snippets. We've also prevented breaking spaces with `white-space: pre`, though I might need to revisit this if I end up writing some very long inline code snippets.

```css
.essay code {
  font-size: 0.85em;
  padding: 0 0.5ch;
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
  border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  border-radius: 1px;
  white-space: pre;
}
```

### Styling code blocks

We already set up some basic styles for `<pre>` elements, so all we need to do is remove the styles we just set for any `<code>` elements that appear within them.

```scss
pre {
  border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
  padding: calc((1em * var(--base-lh)) - 2px);
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
  overflow-x: scroll;

  code {
    padding: 0;
    background-color: transparent;
    border: none;
  }
}
```

The final thing to do is add syntax highlighting. Since we're using Jekyll, any fenced code blocks that have a language defined on them will use [Rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/) to apply syntax-highlighing classes in the same way [Pygments](https://pygments.org/) does. This means we can take an existing theme stylesheet and include it in our bundle. I used [this one](https://github.com/jwarby/jekyll-pygments-themes/blob/master/colorful.css) and tweaked a few of the colours slightly. I'll come back to this once I have a colour palette for the site.

## Horizontal Rules

I've always liked the section mark (§) and thought it might be nice to superimpose this on horizontal rules. The code for this is pretty simple – we'll add a psuedo-element containing the mark and use flexbox to position the hr and psuedo element on top of each other. A bit of padding and a background on the psuedo element creates a gap in the line, and a little nudging with `translateY` vertically centres the mark.

![Horizontal Rule](/uploads/2020-06-28-hr.png){:.border}

```scss
.essay hr {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;

  border: 0;
  border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);

  &:before {
    content: '§';
    transform: translateY(-0.15em);
    background: var(--color-white);
    padding: 0 0.5em;
  }
}
```

It would also be nice to add a little more margin than usual either side of the rule. Since we're using **only** top-margin to maintain vertical rhythm, we need to use the sibling selector to add margin to the element immediatly following the `<hr>` as well as the rule itself.

```css
.essay hr,
.essay hr + * {
  margin-top: calc(2em * var(--base-lh));
}
```
