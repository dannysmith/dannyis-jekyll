title: These Notes
---

I wanted a place to keep short thoughts and notes. Stuff that's a bit too big for a tweet, but too small for a proper article on here.

**This is that place.**

It uses many of the same styles as my longer [writing](/writing), but without all of the typographic flourishes.

I think it's important to have a place to publish short thoughts and notes without too much friction.
