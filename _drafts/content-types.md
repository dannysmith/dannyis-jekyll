title: Website Redesign Part ???? - Content Types
---

With any project like this, I like to take an inventory of the different types of content I need to consider. In this case, there's a bunch of stuff that I _might_ want to put on this site.

{:.postit-grid}
- Articles written on this site.
- Other writing (about page etc).
- Links to articles written elsewhere.
- Links to articles I've read in Pocket.
- Links to articles I've clapped for in Medium.
- Videos I've published on Youtube or Loom.
- Videos of my music.
- Books I recommend.
- Books I'm reading or have read.
- Short notes â€“ less than articles but more than tweets, often in response to some media. (I used to use [tumblr for this](https://notes.danny.is/).)

Of course, this list might change over time.

## A ponder on organising these things

I've no intention of building out all these things right now, but since I know about them it's well to consider them as a whole while I'm thinking about design.

The common first words in suggest some obvious core components:

- Article
- Link
- Video
- Book
- Note

Before I start thinking about the visual design of these components, I want to spend on how I might organise and group them them. (This is a bit of a mind wander...)

### Work | Pleasure

There is an obvious divide between stuff related to work and stuff that isn't. But much of my content doesn't fit neatly into one of these boxes so this doesn't seem like a good choice for top-level organisation. I could maybe use colour to mark things as "more worky" or more "personalish", but I'm not sure how useful that would be to readers. Moreover, I tend to blend work and personal stuff a lot in my life so it doesn't feel **authentic**.

### Creating | Consuming

I've been thinking a lot about this recently, and the content types above fit quite well into these boxes. Stuff I'm reading (books, articles) are _consumed_, whereas my articles and videos are _created_. The only thing which doesn't fit well here is short notes because they often contain a bit of both.

I like the idea of differentiating between these two modes.

### Permanent | Throw-away

I intend for some stuff on here to be etched in stone. My longer-form articles, for instance. I care much less about some of the other stuff. Should I differentiate between these?

### Written | Other Media

Since one of my goals for this redesign is to "Put my writing at the front, and make it beautiful", it makes sense for me to visually differentiate my longer-form writing from any other content.

But it might also make sense for me to keep my writing completely separate.

## Whiteboarding

Include photos of whiteboard from phone/postits app.

#### Type of thing

This helps me identify the components I need to design.

* Essay - words
* Words + design
    * Coaching offering
    * Looking for work
    * About me
* Videos
    * Music Videos
    * Youtube Series'
* Objects (with words + metadata)
    * Book Recommendations
    * Short Notes and Thoughts
* Links + Meta
    * Links to social
    * Medium article
    * Links to essays (on this site)
    * Dev To articles
    * Medium claps
    * Pocket links

I have already designed an essay.
I need to design the (words+design) pages
I need to design a video object
I need to design a Object object
I need to design a link.

By far the most common thing here is links. So I should maybe focus on that first?

### Culling and Simplifying

Can I make this simpler?

lookingofrwork - use a notion page
Youtube Series - Simple section or page with one entry for each series, not individual videos
Short notes and thoughts - A notion database? Or is it better I own these?
coaching - not yet, I don't have the content.
singing - redirect to dannysmithblues youtube

### Components I need to design

* Box for video or notion series
    * Image
    * Title
    * Description
    * Notion Link
    * Youtube playlist link
* Link List
    * Title
    * My content or someone else's?
    * Date (optional)
    * Platform (optional - here/medium/pocket/devto)
* Section /page header
    * Title
    * Text explaining what the page/section is about
* Site Navigation
* Footer
    * Copyright
    * RSS
    * Twitter
    * Youtube
    * What I do short blurb
* About
    * Photo
    * Text
* Banner
    * General use announcement banner/box
* Newsletter Signup form

### Labelling content

Tier 1
* People (Human)
* Process (Systems)
* Other (personal, coding etc)

Tier 2
* Management & People
* Teaching & Coaching (the skill of)
* Systems & Process
* Coding & Design

## The Concept

I'll design each of these components (or blocks) in isolation, making extensive use of type. I'll then compose them to form interesting swiss-influenced designs for pages. In the future, I might add new blocks to represent featured articles, collections of articles, or individual external content items like videos.

I'll subtly differentiate blocks based on the Tier 1 and Tier 2  labels above.

Design principles
1. Use type to add visual interest, not imagery or effects.
2. Think in terms of blocks that can be visually composed together.
3. Design in greyscale first. The site should always look okay in greyscale.
4. Remove everything that is neither useful or beautiful. Prefer things that are both.
5. Use whitespace. A lot.
