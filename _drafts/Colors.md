# Colors

I like colours. 

Previous attempts to create a personal colour palette have ended in failure.

Example: Sparta palette

Example: Rootpath palette

## Use Cases

Firstly, there's this website. 

But there's also some other use cases:

* Headers for Twitter, Notion, LinkedIn etc.
* Slide decks and documents I create.
* Video intros and outros.

These are all cool with only a small palette.

Finally there is **code**.

A code theme needs a lot of colourise because they have a practical purpose. To a non-programmer, this might look way too colourful:

<show super varied code scereenshot>

But without all that syntax highlighting, it would be really hard for brains to parse the information.

So while the best color schemes are generally quite constrained, when it comes to this sort of thing, there is no escaping the fact we need a wide array of *different* colours. So the goal here is making them harmonious.
