# Designing a Personal Mark

Designing a personal mark is the most self-indulgent thing in the world. It's also supremely difficult.

Examples:

Wes Bos - a simple crown
Bruce - Stole the Bruce lion
Frank Chimero - A monogram he's used for years (see https://codepen.io/dannysmith/pen/XWXVgPO)

I've toyed with all sorts of ideas for this, but they mostly run into the same issue. I worry that whatever I choose won't feel relevant in a few years time. 

Which is why I've decided on a monogram. Short of changing my name, it's unlikely to become irrelevant anytime soon.

Uses

* My website and other digital stuff.
* Stickers
* Physical stuff like shorts, stamps, rings etc.

Requirements

* Must work in black and white, both black on white and white on black.
* Must work at small and largish sizes
* Must be possible to engrave, embroider etc
* Must fit neatly in a square or a circle.

I also want it to feel simple and modern, so that probably means an absence of fancy swashes and calligraphy.
