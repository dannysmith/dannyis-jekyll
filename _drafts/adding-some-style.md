# Old-style Numbers

Old-style numbers

```css
.essay h1 > p {
  font-variant-numeric: oldstyle-nums;
}
```

# Bold and Italic

# Abbreviaions

Abbreviations nearly always look best rendered in small caps, so we're doing that for any `<abbr>` tags. We're also changing the dotted underline to a slightly more subtle colour. It's little touches like this that make a huge difference to the overall feel of a site.

```css
.essay abbr {
  text-transform: lowercase;
  font-variant: small-caps;
  text-decoration-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```

# First line & Drop Caps

# End mark

# Widows
