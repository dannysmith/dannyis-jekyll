title: Website Redesign Part ???? - Content Types
---

With any project like this, I like to take an inventory of the different types of content I need to consider. In this case, there's a bunch of stuff that I _might_ want to put on this site.

{:.postit-grid}

- Articles written on this site.
- Other writing (about page etc).
- Links to articles written elsewhere.
- Links to articles I've read in Pocket.
- Links to articles I've clapped for in Medium.
- Videos I've published on Youtube or Loom.
- Videos of my music.
- Books I recommend.
- Books I'm reading or have read.
- Short notes â€“ less than articles but more than tweets, often in response to some media. (I used to use [tumblr for this](https://notes.danny.is/).)

Of course, this list might change over time.

## A ponder on organising these things

I've no intention of building out all these things right now, but since I know about them it's well to consider them as a whole while I'm thinking about design.

The common first words in suggest some obvious core components:

- Article
- Link
- Video
- Book
- Note

Before I start thinking about the visual design of these components, I want to spend on how I might organise and group them them. (This is a bit of a mind wander...)

#### Work | Pleasure

There is an obvious divide between stuff related to work and stuff that isn't. But much of my content doesn't fit neatly into one of these boxes so this doesn't seem like a good choice for top-level organisation. I could maybe use colour to mark things as "more worky" or more "personalish", but I'm not sure how useful that would be to readers. Moreover, I tend to blend work and personal stuff a lot in my life so it doesn't feel **authentic**.

#### Creating | Consuming

I've been thinking a lot about this recently, and the content types above fit quite well into these boxes. Stuff I'm reading (books, articles) are _consumed_, whereas my articles and videos are _created_. The only thing which doesn't fit well here is short notes because they often contain a bit of both.

I like the idea of differentiating between these two modes.

#### Permanent | Throw-away

I intend for some stuff on here to be etched in stone. My longer-form articles, for instance. I care much less about some of the other stuff. Should I differentiate between these?

#### Written | Other Media

Since one of my goals for this redesign is to "Put my writing at the front, and make it beautiful", it makes sense for me to visually differentiate my longer-form writing from any other content.

But it might also make sense for me to keep my writing completely separate.
